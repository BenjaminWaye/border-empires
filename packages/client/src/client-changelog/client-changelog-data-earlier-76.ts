    title: "Galaxy View button moved above the minimap on mobile",
    why: "On mobile the 🌌 Galaxy View launcher was anchored just above the bottom nav bar, which put it below/behind the minimap panel instead of clear of it.",

      "On mobile, the Galaxy View launcher now sits above the minimap instead of tucked in behind it near the bottom nav bar"

    title: "Fixed a defended tile briefly flashing neutral when you attacked it",
    why: "A tile you attacked (or that had an active attack lock on it, as either side) could render as unowned/neutral for a split second, even though it never actually changed hands -- most reliably reproduced on a failed/repelled attack against an already-owned, defended tile. Two separate server code paths were building a tile update that omitted ownerId/ownershipState instead of including their real (unchanged) values, which the client always reads as an explicit ownership clear.",
    changes: [
      "A tile visible to you only because you have an active attack lock on it now still reports its real owner instead of stripping ownership info entirely",
      "A repelled attack against a defended tile no longer sends a battle-effect update that omits the tile's ownership, which was momentarily flashing it neutral client-side"
    ]
