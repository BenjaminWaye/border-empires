    title: "March flags now show real troop movement while fighting through neutral ground toward their target",
    why: "A MARCH-mode muster flag with no attackable enemy tile in range falls back to expanding onto the nearest neutral tile blocking the route to its target, making real progress toward it every tick. But that fallback's ACTION_ACCEPTED broadcast was silently dropped client-side -- this client never submitted the auto-fired command, so it had no matching in-flight action for the normal gate to bind it to -- unlike the equivalent ATTACK-mode fallback, which already gets a second chance via COMBAT_START. The result: a March flag chewing through neutral land toward its target looked completely stationary, indistinguishable from one that was actually stuck.",
    changes: [
      "A March flag's neutral-tile expansion toward its target now draws the same marching/travel visual an Advance or March attack already gets, in both the 3D and 2D map renderers",
      "The 2D map's supply-line overlay now also covers Advance/March auto-fire moves directly (previously it only found them via an Advance-only fallback lookup, missing March mode and any neutral-tile expansion leg entirely)"
    ]

    introducedIn: "2026.09.04.14",
    title: "Building a structure on a forest tile now clears its trees in the true-3D renderer too",
    why: "The true-3D renderer added a forest instance to every forest tile unconditionally, with no regard for whether an economic structure had since been built there -- so trees kept showing through/around a built structure in 3D even though the 2D canvas renderer already correctly clears them (its structure sprite paints over the tile). The two renderers disagreed on what a built forest tile should look like.",
    changes: [
      "The true-3D renderer no longer places a forest tree instance on a tile once an economic structure is built there, matching the 2D renderer's existing behavior"
    ]

    introducedIn: "2026.09.04.13",
    title: "Attacks that couldn't stage a new muster flag, or whose staged flag wasn't right on the border, now still launch",
    why: "Attacking an enemy-owned tile with no adjacent or remotely-funded ready flag nearby makes the client auto-create a fresh muster flag on your origin tile to stage the attack. If you were already at your muster-flag cap, that auto-create was silently rejected with MUSTER_LIMIT and the attack just sat parked until a 5-second timeout cancelled it outright. Separately, a staged attack only ever launched once its funding flag literally bordered the enemy tile, even though the server funds an ATTACK from any owned flag within 10 tiles of wherever you're actually attacking from -- the same remote-funding range ADVANCE auto-fire already relies on -- so a flag a few tiles back that had already filled up never got used.",
    changes: [
      "When staging a new muster flag for an attack hits the muster-flag cap, the attack now reroutes onto your closest usable existing flag and waits for it to fill/march instead of being cancelled",
      "A staged attack now also launches once any owned flag within remote-funding range of your attacking tile is ready, not only one standing directly on the enemy's border",
      "A feed message now explains when a reroute happens, naming which existing flag the attack will use"
    ]

    introducedIn: "2026.09.04.13",
    title: "Aether Purge is now actually blocked by a defending Aether Tower",
    why: "The only real check AETHER_LANCE (\"Aether Purge\") ran server-side was for an enemy Aegis Dome -- an enemy Aether Tower's protection was purely a client-side courtesy that only decided what a well-behaved client greyed out as untargetable, so it never stopped the ability from actually landing. A target within a defending, active, off-cooldown Aether Tower's protection radius could still be purged.",
    changes: [
      "AETHER_LANCE (Aether Purge) now rejects server-side when the target is within an enemy's active, off-cooldown, non-dormant Aether Tower's protection radius, matching what the client already implied was true"
    ]
  },
