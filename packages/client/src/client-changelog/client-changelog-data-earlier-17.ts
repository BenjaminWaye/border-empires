    title: "Dock sea-route lines actually render again",
    why: "The islands mapgen was reworked on Aug 27-28 (bigger islands, more land). Seasons generated before that rework play on terrain frozen at their creation, but the client re-derives terrain procedurally using whatever worldgen code is in the current build -- so the client started seeing land where the season actually has sea, its route pathfinder could no longer find a sea path, and the dashed line silently stopped drawing. The two prior fixes for this shipped the correct route from the server but it never survived the trip: the simulation-to-gateway message schema had no field for it, so it was dropped in transit every time.",
    changes: [
      "The dashed dock-to-dock sea route line draws again, following the season's real frozen terrain instead of a recomputed approximation that drifts whenever map generation changes"
    ]

    introducedIn: "2026.08.31.2",
    title: "Fixed the decay countdown missing entirely on some out-of-reach frontier tiles",
    why: "A frontier tile decaying because it's out of your reach re-stamps its decay deadline on every reach recheck, but the server only sent the paired \"why it's decaying\" tag alongside a deadline the very first time either one changed. A tile whose deadline kept refreshing while that tag itself never changed again could end up with a connection that had simply never received the tag -- the client then had a decay deadline with no matching reason, so it couldn't tell the countdown apart from an ordinary \"outside your reach\" tile and just showed \"Outside reach\" with no timer at all.",
    changes: [
      "The server now always resends both the decay deadline and its reason together, so a decaying frontier tile's tile menu reliably shows its \"decays in Xs\" countdown instead of sometimes silently falling back to a plain \"Outside reach\" line."

    title: "Aether Purge now alerts the empire that lost the tile",
    why: "Aether Purge silently turned a hostile tile neutral with no signal to the empire that lost it — unlike a conventional attack, which alerts the defender in the Activity Feed and by email. Purge victims found out only by noticing the tile had changed color on the map.",
    changes: [
      "Getting Aether Purged now posts a drastic 'Aether Attack!' Activity Feed alert naming the attacker and the tile lost, with a Center action to jump to it",
      "Purge victims also get an email alert (subject to the same one-email-per-hour throttle as conventional attack alerts) if they have email notifications set up"

    title: "Fixed Mercantile Charter's bonus never showing, and support buildings near the map edge (or built on the town itself) not being counted",
    why: "Two separate bugs compounded into \"my town's bonuses aren't showing\": (1) the tile-detail fetch that opening a tile's popup uses never computed Mercantile Charter's gold/growth bonus at all -- the field was stripped before being cached, and the popup's own fallback math never looked it up in the first place; (2) Mintworks and other support buildings can legally be built directly on a town's own tile, but the counting code only ever scanned the 8 surrounding tiles, silently missing an on-tile building; (3) that same counting code built neighbor-tile lookups without accounting for the map wrapping at its edges, so a support building on a tile reachable only by wrapping around the map's east/south edge was also silently missed.",
    changes: [
      "Mercantile Charter's gold/growth bonus now shows correctly on a town's tile popup instead of disappearing after the first load",
      "A Mintworks (or Garrison Hall, Weapons Workshop, Titanium/Umbrite Works, Clearing House, Logistics Guild) built directly on a town's own tile now counts toward that town's bonuses",
      "Support buildings on a tile reachable only by wrapping around the map's edge now count toward the nearby town's bonuses"
    ]

    introducedIn: "2026.08.30.7",
    title: "Fixed Trade Nexus showing a duplicate 2D overlay on the 3D map",
    why: "Trade Nexus (CARAVANARY) draws its own dedicated range overlay directly in the 3D renderer, bypassing the generic 3D structure-overlay set that the 2D canvas checks to decide whether to skip its own overlay image. Because Trade Nexus wasn't in that set, the 2D fallback overlay kept drawing on top of the 3D one for every player on the 3D renderer.",
    changes: [
      "Trade Nexus no longer shows a flat 2D overlay image layered on top of its 3D range overlay"
    ]
  },
