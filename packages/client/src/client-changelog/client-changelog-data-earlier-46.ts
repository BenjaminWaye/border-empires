    introducedIn: "2026.09.07.10",
    title: "Muster flag progress now animates smoothly instead of jumping every ~30s",
    why: "Manpower staged on a muster flag only updated server-side in sparse ticks, so the tile menu, manpower panel, and the 3D map's fill bar all showed frozen numbers for long stretches, then a visible jump. Sustained clicking/dragging traffic could also starve other queued actions (like the flag's own status updates) behind it indefinitely.",
    changes: [
      "The tile menu, manpower panel's Active muster flags list, and the 3D map's muster fill bar now interpolate a flag's staged amount continuously between server updates instead of holding flat then jumping",
      "The tile menu now repaints a muster tile's staged/cap readout roughly every 250ms while its menu is open, and the manpower panel's flag list now animates HOLD flags too (previously only Advance/March flags got a live repaint)",
      "Fixed a job-queue fairness issue where a steady stream of interactive commands (clicks, drags) could indefinitely starve background command types (including muster-flag status updates) queued behind them"
