    introducedIn: "2026.09.08.1",
    title: "Freshly-planted muster flags now show a live rate immediately instead of sitting at 0 for up to 30s",
    why: "The muster-smoothing fix from 2026.09.07.10 could only interpolate a flag's progress once the server had sent at least one real sample -- but a brand-new flag had no rate at all until the next periodic tick, up to 30 seconds later, so it sat frozen at exactly 0 with nothing to animate from.",
    changes: [
      "Setting (or planting a sibling) muster flag now stamps a correct accrual rate on the very same response, so the tile menu and manpower panel start climbing immediately instead of waiting on the next server sweep",
      "Planting a new flag also immediately refreshes the accrual rate shown on that player's other active flags (since sharing throughput across more flags changes everyone's rate), instead of leaving them stale until the next sweep"
    ]
  },
