    introducedIn: "2026.09.03.3",
    title: "Fixed muster flags surviving on tiles you just captured deep in enemy territory",
    why: "ATTACK only requires your origin tile to be owned, not the target to be inside your own live vision -- so a raid chained through your own previously-claimed (possibly out-of-reach) frontier ground could capture a tile you have no coverage of at all. The server always destroyed the defender's muster flag on capture, but the corrected tile update was only ever force-delivered to the defender who lost it, not to you as the attacker. If the newly-captured tile sat outside your own vision, your own game's normal visibility check silently dropped that update, leaving your client showing the enemy's stale muster flag on ground that was already yours.",
    changes: [
      "A captured tile's resolved state (ownership, and any muster flag being cleared) is now always force-delivered to the attacker as well as the previous owner, regardless of whether the tile is inside the attacker's own current vision"
    ]

    createdAt: 1788515318987, // frozen from `node -e "console.log(Date.now())"`
    introducedIn: "2026.09.03.1",
    title: "Fixed a repeating \"tile already has structure\" error while queued buildings drain",
    why: "The server-side dev-queue auto-drain (which exists so queued builds/settles keep progressing while a player is offline) fired on every freed development slot regardless of whether the player's own client was connected and already draining the same queue -- so an online player's client and the server could both dispatch the same queued build. The loser hit a real BUILD_INVALID \"tile already has structure\" rejection once the winner's structure landed. The waypoint/expand queue already stands down while its owning client is online; the build/settle queue never got the equivalent guard.",
    changes: [
      "The server no longer auto-drains a player's build/settle queue while that player is online -- their own client now owns dispatch exclusively, the same as it already did for the waypoint/expand queue",
      "Queued builds no longer occasionally throw a spurious \"tile already has structure\" error toast"
    ]

    createdAt: 1788458684672, // frozen from `node -e "console.log(Date.now())"`
    introducedIn: "2026.09.03.4",
    title: "ADVANCE mustering flags now strike the nearest enemy tile, not just whichever one the search reaches first",
    why: "ADVANCE auto-fire used to stop its search the instant it found any attackable enemy tile, so once nearby fronts were locked by other combat (including your own sibling flags) it could keep walking through your territory and end up firing on a tile far across your empire, simply because that was the first unlocked tile it happened to reach -- even when a genuinely closer target existed nearby.",
    changes: [
      "ADVANCE auto-fire now compares every reachable attackable enemy tile and strikes the one nearest the flag instead of the first one its search encounters",
      "Added a hard range cap: if the nearest reachable target is too far away (every closer front locked or contested), the flag idles instead of launching a moon-shot attack on the far side of the map",
      "The range cap is measured in hops through owned territory, not raw map distance, so a flag on a dock is still not penalized for a legitimate cross-water strike"
    ]

    introducedIn: "2026.09.03.4",
    title: "Fixed being able to build more than one of the same monument component",
    why: "Each monument component (e.g. Imperial Exchange's Golden Ledger) is meant to be a unique one-of -- a player assembles exactly one of each of a monument's 3 parts before the monument itself can go up. Nothing stopped building the same part type on multiple tiles instead of building the other two, so a player could stockpile duplicates of one part and never actually assemble the monument. The build menu also didn't warn about this until the server rejected the command.",
    changes: [
      "Building a monument component you already own (anywhere, active or still under construction) is now rejected server-side",
      "The build menu button for a component you already own is now disabled up front and shows \"Part already built in nearby town\" instead of only failing after you submit"
