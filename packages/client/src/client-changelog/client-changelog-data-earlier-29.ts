    title: "Fixed muster flags surviving on tiles you just captured deep in enemy territory",
    why: "ATTACK only requires your origin tile to be owned, not the target to be inside your own live vision -- so a raid chained through your own previously-claimed (possibly out-of-reach) frontier ground could capture a tile you have no coverage of at all. The server always destroyed the defender's muster flag on capture, but the corrected tile update was only ever force-delivered to the defender who lost it, not to you as the attacker. If the newly-captured tile sat outside your own vision, your own game's normal visibility check silently dropped that update, leaving your client showing the enemy's stale muster flag on ground that was already yours.",
    changes: [
      "A captured tile's resolved state (ownership, and any muster flag being cleared) is now always force-delivered to the attacker as well as the previous owner, regardless of whether the tile is inside the attacker's own current vision"

    introducedIn: "2026.09.03.1",
    title: "Fixed a repeating \"tile already has structure\" error while queued buildings drain",
    why: "The server-side dev-queue auto-drain (which exists so queued builds/settles keep progressing while a player is offline) fired on every freed development slot regardless of whether the player's own client was connected and already draining the same queue -- so an online player's client and the server could both dispatch the same queued build. The loser hit a real BUILD_INVALID \"tile already has structure\" rejection once the winner's structure landed. The waypoint/expand queue already stands down while its owning client is online; the build/settle queue never got the equivalent guard.",
    changes: [
      "The server no longer auto-drains a player's build/settle queue while that player is online -- their own client now owns dispatch exclusively, the same as it already did for the waypoint/expand queue",
      "Queued builds no longer occasionally throw a spurious \"tile already has structure\" error toast"
    ]
