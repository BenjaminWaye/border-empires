// Older client-changelog entries, split out of client-changelog-data-earlier-2.ts
// to keep that file under the repo's 500-line cap (see the comment at
// client-changelog-data.ts's top). Same shape and rules apply here:
// unordered, append-only, frozen createdAt literals.
//
// Entries here are still bound by the "latest week only" rule enforced in
// client-changelog.test.ts — this file exists purely to keep the other
// changelog data files under their line cap when the trailing week has a lot
// of entries, not as a permanent archive. Prune entries here once they fall
// outside the trailing week, same as in the other three files.
