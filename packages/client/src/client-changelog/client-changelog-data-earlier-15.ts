    title: "Fixed a false \"missing weapons factory\" attack-preview penalty against offline opponents",
    why: "An earlier fix made the attack preview look up a target's Titanium/Umbrite Weapons Factory counts from that player's own server-side data instead of the attacker's own limited view of the map, so breaking an alliance (which drops shared vision) couldn't cause a false penalty anymore. But that server-side data is only kept in memory while a player is actively connected -- so previewing an attack against an opponent who happened to be offline at that moment still fell back to scanning the attacker's own limited view, reproducing the same false penalty under a different trigger.",
    changes: [
      "Attack previews against an offline opponent's territory now correctly reflect their real weapons-factory counts, instead of sometimes wrongly applying the missing-factory penalty"
    ]

    introducedIn: "2026.09.02.6",
    title: "3D map: frontier tint and fog-of-war are transparent again",
    why: "The previous shadow-visibility fix switched the ownership-tint overlay to a multiply blend so a tile's cast shadow shows through settled territory's tint -- but that overlay's rendering code is shared with frontier tint and both fog-of-war layers, and multiply blending always darkens the ground rather than mixing toward the tint color the way the old alpha blend did. Frontier tiles and fogged (unrevealed) tiles started reading as a heavy, near-opaque wash instead of a subtle one, and the ground under them looked darker overall.",
    changes: [
      "Frontier tint and fog-of-war are back to their original translucent look",
      "Settled/owned territory keeps the new shadow-visible-through-tint look unchanged"
    ]
