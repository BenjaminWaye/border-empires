    title: "Wonder parts now cost Shard, not just the finished Wonder",
    why: "Each Wonder's 3 prerequisite parts only ever cost manpower to build, with the Shard cost only charged on the final assembly. That let a player stockpile every part for free and made the Shard gate trivially easy to clear at the very end.",
    changes: [
      "Every Wonder part building now also costs 1 Shard to build, on top of its existing manpower cost",
      "A completed Wonder now consumes 5 Shard total across its build chain (3 for the parts, 2 for the final assembly), up from 2"

    title: "Fleets now take real build time, can hold at home as a garrison, and the Senate/Fleets target pickers say what they're for",
    why: "Player feedback: a Dreadnought costs 500 Production against a Planet's 6-8/Cycle trickle, but a fleet departed the instant it was paid for -- there was no way to just build a fleet and keep it at home, the unlabeled ⚡ speed stat next to damage read as an unexplained \"electricity\" icon, and the Senate panel's unlabeled target dropdown below the two proposal cards had no indication of what it picked.",
    changes: [
      "Sending a fleet now takes real build time (3 minutes per point of Production cost) before it actually departs -- the fleet panel shows a BUILDING status with a \"departs in ~Xh\" countdown, then TRAVELING once it's underway; the composition summary now shows a Build time alongside Cost/Damage/Travel",
      "The fleet target picker now has a \"Hold at home (garrison, no combat)\" group listing your own territories -- sending there creates a standing garrison fleet with no raid resolution, battle log entry, or Stability effect, shown with a house icon and a \"(home)\" label",
      "Each hull card's stat row now reads \"80 cost / 50 dmg / 4 spd\" instead of bare icons+numbers, so the ⚡ speed stat can't be misread as unrelated to the damage number next to it",
      "Both the Fleets and Senate target dropdowns now have a \"Target\" label and a disabled \"Choose a target...\" placeholder instead of silently defaulting to whichever option happened to load first",
      "New optional departsAt/orderKind fields on GET /hq/galaxy/fleets orders power this -- purely additive, existing callers are unaffected"
