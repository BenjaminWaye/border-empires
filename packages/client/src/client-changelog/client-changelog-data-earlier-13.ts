    title: "Trees and most structures now cast real shadows on the 3D map",
    why: "The 3D renderer never turned on WebGL shadow mapping, so nothing in the scene ever cast or received a real shadow no matter how a mesh's own castShadow/receiveShadow flags were set -- trees especially read as flatly lit and \"pasted on\" the ground instead of grounded, most noticeably under the raking sun angle from a recent lighting pass.",
    changes: [
      "Trees and most structures (economic, late-game, civic, infrastructure, industrial, manpower, worldbreaker, imperial exchange, astral dock, and population bureau buildings) now cast a real shadow onto the ground and onto each other on the 3D map, instead of only the flat contact-shadow decal underneath them",
      "Town buildings, forts, watchtowers, mountains, resource deposits, and docks don't cast real shadows yet -- they still only show the flat contact-shadow decal"
    ]

    title: "AI empires now keep a manpower reserve so they can actually fight back",
    why: "AI empires spent every point of manpower regen on expanding the moment it became affordable (unlocked at just 10 manpower), while attacking required 60 -- so an AI's manpower could mathematically never climb high enough to launch an attack. Confirmed live: several AI empires lost dozens of tiles a day to barbarian raids while sitting completely idle, unable to ever fight back.",
    changes: [
      "AI empires now hold back a manpower reserve for attacking instead of spending every point on expansion and building, so they can actually respond to sustained threats"
