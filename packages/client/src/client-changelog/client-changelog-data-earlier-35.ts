    introducedIn: "2026.09.04.4",
    title: "Aether Purge alerts now show the attacker's real display name",
    why: "The simulation never learns a player's real display name -- ATTACK_ALERT already got its attackerName patched up to the attacker's live profile name at the gateway, but AETHER_PURGE_ALERT was left out of that same hydration path, so a purge from a player with a set display name still showed the anonymized \"Empire XXXXXX\" fallback in both the in-app alert and the email.",
    changes: [
      "Aether Purge in-app alerts and emails now show the attacker's real display name when they have one set, instead of always falling back to an anonymized Empire ID"

    introducedIn: "2026.09.04.11",
    title: "The Galactic Senate is now reachable from Space View",
    why: "The Senate backend (Galactic Senate v1) shipped with no way for a real player to use it -- proposing and voting only existed as raw HTTP endpoints. This adds the missing client surface: a Senate panel inside Space View, next to Manage Planet and Settings.",
    changes: [
      "New Senate button in Space View opens a panel listing recent proposals and lets you cast a Dominion-weighted vote on any still-pending one",
      "The same panel lets you raise a new Embargo or Contest proposal against any publicly held territory other than your own",
      "Clear inline messages for the common failure cases: not enough Influence, not a Planet-holder, target on cooldown, or already voted"
    ]

    introducedIn: "2026.09.04.10",
    title: "Defense Campaign seasons now actually spin up and transfer ownership",
    why: "A passed Senate CONTEST vote already forced a territory's Stability to 0, but nothing turned that into a real consequence -- no season ever opened to fight over it, so a Contest was a permanent, un-actionable stability hit rather than the reopened-territory mechanic the design intends. This wires up the missing half: contested territories now automatically queue for and spin up as real seasons, and winning one transfers ownership going forward.",
    changes: [
      "A passed CONTEST now also queues its target territory for a Defense Campaign season, in addition to zeroing its Stability",
      "The natural end-of-season rollover now automatically opens a Defense Campaign season for the oldest queued target roughly two out of every three times a new season starts, reserving the remaining slot for a fresh Frontier campaign",
      "Winning a Defense Campaign season transfers ownership of the original contested territory to you going forward -- it shows up under your held Planets, and its Stability resets to full under your ownership",
      "Planet naming rights are not affected by a Defense Campaign transfer -- they permanently stay with whoever first won and named that territory"

    introducedIn: "2026.09.04.3",
    title: "Fixed enemies keeping settled tiles inside your own borders after a server restart",
    why: "Your reach border isn't saved -- it's rebuilt from your towns/outposts/docks every time the server restarts. That rebuild was skipping the contest that normally decides who keeps contested ground, so if your reach covered a tile a rival held settled, the border quietly became yours while the tile itself stayed theirs. Nothing ever reconciled the two, and because the rebuild ran the same way on every restart, it re-created the same split every time -- leaving rivals parked on settled tiles (resource deposits included) deep inside your border indefinitely.",
    changes: [
      "The border rebuild on server start now runs the same contest a live border push does: a rival settled tile your reach covers is either left alone because they still cover it themselves, or taken and reverted to frontier -- no more permanent split between who owns a tile and who owns the border under it",
      "Existing tiles stuck in that state are reconciled automatically on the next server start"
    ]

    introducedIn: "2026.09.04.2",
    title: "MARCH mustering flags now show the marching-company visualization too",
    why: "MARCH-mode auto-fire attacks already got the mechanical travel-time delay, but the client only ever recognized ADVANCE's own command prefix as a server-dispatched muster attack -- so a MARCH flag's attack never got a skirmish overlay or a marching company on the map, even though the same march was genuinely happening.",
    changes: [
      "MARCH auto-fire attacks now show the same marching-company overlay and pre-resolution skirmish ADVANCE auto-fire attacks already show"
    ]
