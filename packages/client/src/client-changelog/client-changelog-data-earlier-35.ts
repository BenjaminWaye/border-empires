    title: "Aether Purge alerts now show the attacker's real display name",
    why: "The simulation never learns a player's real display name -- ATTACK_ALERT already got its attackerName patched up to the attacker's live profile name at the gateway, but AETHER_PURGE_ALERT was left out of that same hydration path, so a purge from a player with a set display name still showed the anonymized \"Empire XXXXXX\" fallback in both the in-app alert and the email.",
    changes: [
      "Aether Purge in-app alerts and emails now show the attacker's real display name when they have one set, instead of always falling back to an anonymized Empire ID"
    ]
  },
  // Four entries previously here (Galactic Senate reachability, Defense
  // Campaign season spin-up, post-restart border reconciliation, MARCH
  // marching-company visualization) have aged out of the 6-day rolling
  // window (client-changelog.test.ts "keeps only the latest week of
  // entries") and were pruned.
