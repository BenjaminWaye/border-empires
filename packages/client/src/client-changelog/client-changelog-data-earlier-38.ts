    introducedIn: "2026.09.04.5",
    title: "MARCH mustering flags now claim neutral ground blocking their route, instead of idling",
    why: "MARCH auto-fire only ever attacked enemy tiles reachable through territory you already owned -- if the route to your march target ran through unclaimed land instead of an enemy border, the flag just idled, even though claiming that ground was exactly what a player would do by hand to keep advancing.",
    changes: [
      "A MARCH flag now expands onto a neutral tile blocking its route to the target when no enemy tile is reachable at all, instead of idling -- an attackable enemy tile still always wins over expanding when both are reachable",
      "Every command a MARCH (or ADVANCE) flag issues -- attacks and, now, expands alike -- is attributed to the flag's own tile for mechanical travel-time purposes, so an expand claimed by a MARCH flag takes real time to complete just like an attack does, rather than resolving instantly regardless of distance"

    introducedIn: "2026.09.04.12",
    title: "Aether Tower descriptions now show the protection radius and cooldown caveat",
    why: "The Aether Tower's build tooltip and tile-menu status line both claimed it \"blocks hostile crystal actions nearby\" without ever stating the radius, and without saying that the block only applies while the tower is off cooldown -- pickReadyOwnedObservatoryForTarget/hostileObservatoryProtectingTileAt already skip a tower on cooldown when computing protection, so an owner reading the old copy could reasonably assume a nearby tower always shields them, even mid-cooldown, and be surprised when an Aether Purge went through.",
    changes: [
      "Aether Tower's build tooltip now states its exact protection radius",
      "The tile-menu status line for an active Aether Tower now says explicitly when it is on cooldown and therefore not currently blocking hostile crystal actions"
    ]

    introducedIn: "2026.09.04.12",
    title: "Captured forts and economic structures now auto-settle",
    why: "A captured tile always landed as Frontier, and a Frontier tile's fort or economic structure produces no income and is barely defensible -- so a captured building sat idle until you remembered to manually Settle it. Towns and docks already had this problem solved for the out-of-reach case; this extends the same auto-settle behavior to any captured building, on any capture.",
    changes: [
      "A captured fort, observatory, or economic structure now tries to auto-settle immediately, at the same manpower/points cost and development-slot requirement as a manual Settle",
      "If you can't afford it or have no free development slot, the tile falls back to landing Frontier as before, so you can settle it manually once you're able to"

    introducedIn: "2026.09.03.6",
    title: "Manage Planet no longer gets buried behind the Space View screen",
    why: "The Space View launcher and full-screen map were mounted as siblings of the HUD element instead of inside it, so their z-index always painted above the HUD's entire stacking context -- including the Manage Planet overlay, which lives inside the HUD so it can layer correctly against other HUD overlays. Opening Manage Planet from within Space View rendered it underneath the Space View screen, invisible until Space View was closed.",
    changes: [
      "Manage Planet now opens on top of the Space View screen as intended, instead of being hidden behind it until you leave Space View"

    introducedIn: "2026.09.09.06",
    title: "Great Cities gain a second build ring; every population-tier upgrade's income/manpower bonus is halved; upgrade buttons now show their bonus",
    why: "Great City-tier towns had the same 8-tile build ring as every other tier despite their much larger population, and every population-tier upgrade's income and manpower jump was large enough to make lower tiers feel unrewarding by comparison. The upgrade button also never told you what you'd actually get for your gold.",
    changes: [
      "Reaching Great City (or Metropolis) now doubles a town's build ring outward to a second ring of tiles (24 build tiles total instead of 8), letting more support structures feed it",
      "Every population-tier upgrade's gold income and manpower cap/regen bonus is halved relative to the previous tier -- Town +0%/+75 manpower (unchanged income), City +25% income/+150 manpower, Great City +75% income/+300 manpower, Metropolis +110% income/+600 manpower, each stacking on the previous tier's already-halved value",
      "The \"Upgrade Town\" tile action now spells out the income %, manpower cap, and manpower regen you'll get, plus a note when the upgrade adds a second build ring"
    ]
